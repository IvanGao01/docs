## Tenant Member manage

CNOSDB Cloud provides organization management functionality that allows users to invite new users to their organization, specify their email and assign a permission role, and send an invitation link to the client. Additionally, organization owners and admins can change the permission roles of existing clients.
There are three permission roles available in CNOSDB Cloud:

1. Owner: Owners have full control over the organization and can manage its settings, billing, and users. They can also add and remove other owners and members.

2. Member: Members can access and manage the organization's resources, but they do not have full control over the organization. They cannot manage billing or invite new users.

3. Viewer: Viewers have read-only access to the organization's resources. They can view the organization's data but cannot modify or delete it.

By assigning permission roles to users, organization owners can ensure that the right people have access to the right resources and maintain control over their organization's security and data.
