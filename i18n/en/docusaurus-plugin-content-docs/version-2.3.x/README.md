# Introduction

CnosDB is an open source distributed time series database with high performance, high compression rate and high ease of use. The main application scenarios are IoT, Industrial Internet, Telematics, IT operations and maintenance. All the code has been open-sourced in GitHub.主要应用场景为物联网，工业互联网，车联网，IT运维。所有代码均已在 [GitHub](https://github.com/cnosdb/cnosdb) 开源。

We design to take full advantage of the characteristics of temporal data, including structured data, no transactions, less delete updates, write more read less, etc. Therefore, compared with other temporal databases, CnosDB has the following characteristics:

- **High performance**: CnosDB solves time series inflation, theoretically supports time series without upper limit, and supports aggregation query along the time line, including query by equal interval window, query by a column enumeration value window, and window by the length of time interval of adjacent time series records. It has the ability to cache the latest data, and the cache space can be configured to get the latest data at high speed.具备对最新数据的缓存能力，并且可以配置缓存空间，能够高速获取最新数据。
- **Easy to use**: CnosDB provides a clear interface, easy to configure items, supports standard SQL, easy to start, seamlessly integrated with third-party tools, and has convenient data access functions. It supports schemaless ("schemaless") writing method and historical data replenishment (including chaotic writing).支持 schemaless （"无模式"）的写入方式，支持历史数据补录（含乱序写入）
- **Cloud-native**: CnosDB has a native distributed design, data sharding and partitioning, store-and-counter separation, Quorum mechanism, Kubernetes deployment and full observability with ultimate consistency, and can be deployed on public, private and hybrid clouds. Provides multi-tenant capabilities with role-based management for privilege assignment. It supports stateless node addition and deletion in the compute layer and horizontal scaling in the storage layer to increase system storage capacity.提供多租户的功能，有基于角色管理的权限分配。支持计算层无状态增减节点，储存层水平扩展提高系统存储容量。
